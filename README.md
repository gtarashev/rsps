# Rust Posix Shell
`rsps` is (or will be) a POSIX compliant shell written in rust with no external dependencies. The aim is to deviate as little as possible from POSIX shell format, but no guarantees are made. Currently, it has a very minimal and incomplete feature-set. However, there is a very large `TODO` section with what (I think) still needs to be done.
